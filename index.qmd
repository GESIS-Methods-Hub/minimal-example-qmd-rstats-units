This example illustrates the **required** metadata by [`methodshub`](https://github.com/GESIS-Methods-Hub/methodshub).

## Execution of R code

```{r}
1 + 1
```

## Creation of figure with R

```{r}
plot(rnorm(10), rnorm(10))
```

## Dependencies

Packages that need to be installed for the reader should be listed in the `install.R` file. For example,

```r
install.packages("units")
```

R packages with system requirements, must have the system requirements installed using the `apt.txt`. For example,

```
libudunits2-dev
```

With the R package in the `install.R` file and the system requirements in the `apt.txt` file, is possible to execute

```{r}
library(units)

spd1 = set_units(1:5, m/s)

spd2 = set_units(1:5, km/h)

spd1 + spd2
```
